# MultiMod

MultiMod is a simple Gradle plugin to be used by Minecraft mods. Its purpose is to make build scripts smaller,
reducing duplication among them, and to make it easier to develop mods for both the Fabric and NeoForge modloaders.

MultiMod is mainly created for use in my own mods, but anyone is free to use it. MultiMod is currently in development,
and this README is to be expanded soon.

TO-DOs are supporting proper dependency configurations for Fabric Loom and ModDev, as well as other Loom/ModDev
configurations. Another big TO-DO is using Minecraft's own deobfuscated sources in the common module. These TO-DOs
will all be worked on in the future, once Fabric Loom and ModDev have adjusted to Mojang's deobfuscated builds.
For now, the project is in maintenance mode.
