# MultiMod

MultiMod is a simple Gradle plugin to be used by Minecraft mods. Its purpose is to make build scripts smaller,
reducing duplication among them, and to make it easier to develop mods for both the Fabric and NeoForge modloaders.

MultiMod is mainly created for use in my own mods, but anyone is free to use it. MultiMod is currently in development,
and this README is to be expanded soon.

TO-DOs are easy process resources configurations, and maybe other things to make buildscripts cleaner.
